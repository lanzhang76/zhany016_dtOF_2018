# Ghost Town Scene

I'm creating a scene of a ghost town. My main characters are the main ghost that's made out of 15 circlees with different masses with a different lerping speed towards the mouse. Around the main ghost, there are a vector system of movers moving in a circular motion around the main ghost that symbolizes the mini ghosts that follow. They will rotate within their 2D dimension in the front of the screen. A grid of houses in a 3D space are moving to the back of Z axis to create a illusion that my 2D ghost is moving. Once they reach the furtherest point, they will regenerate themselves at the front. There are an array of concentric circles created as the backdrop of the scene. They go outward while fading out the color. Once they reach the outter ring, they also regenerate from the center.
